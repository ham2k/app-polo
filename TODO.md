# Bugs

* Numbers don't work (ios?)
* Don't allow QSOs until a band is selected
* On K0GR's tablet, using external keyboard would cause virtual one to pop up
  One quirk I had on my ~10yo tablet was when I wanted to edit a field and clicked a button, it would quickly open and close the keyboard. A second click and it would open and stay open. Not sure that's the app or my tablet.

# Minor Tasks

* Secondary fields should be focused after opening them

# Ready to Develop

* Switch report fields after two (or three) digits
* SOTA
* Location
* WWFF
* Search POTA / SOTA / WWFF by name
* Fix time entry to use previous QSO info if missing
* Fix time entry, make format less strict, and dates relative to today

# Feature Ideas

* Autocomplete POTA or SOTA references based on spots
* Better spot filtering and ordering. Define bands and modes you care about
* When changing operation settings, warn that it applies to all QSOs
* Countdown to POTA midnight
* POTA early and late shifts indicator and countdowns
* Ask for POTA state for references in multiple states
* WSJT-X Logging
* Audio Notes
* Upload to POTA.app
* Upload to QRZ
* Upload to ClubLog
* Upload to other logging services
* CAT Monitoring/Control
* POTA Self-spotting
* Queue callsigns

Refactor home screen.
  * Mark operations as "completed" and/or "archived"
  * Group operations by date


# Completed
* Cached POTA database
* Search POTA by name
* POTA Spots
* Refactor Operation name/title
