# POTA Notes

[Rules](https://docs.pota.app/docs/rules.html)

### Scoring

Resets each UTC day.

10 QSOs in a day counts as an activation.

1 QSO per contact with unique callsign, band, mode and park.

Callsign variations, such as /P and /M, count as unique.

### Logging

Minimum log requirement is call, band and mode. Frequency and signal reports are not needed.

Uses ADIF logs with `SIG`, `SIG_INFO` and `MY_SIG`, `MY_SIG_INFO`.

QSOs with multiple refrences should be duplicated and logged as separate QSOs.

ADIF also provides `POTA_REF` and `MY_POTA_REF` but those are not yet used by the POTA program.
