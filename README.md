# Known Issues

### Android builds from the metro bundler terminal

Because of a mess with our multiple build flavors, under RN 0.73 the default way of running android for development is broken
so you cannot just press `a` from the metro bundler terminal to run the app on android.

Instead, run the metro bundler (`npm start`) on one terminal, and run `npm run android` on another to build the app.

Afterwards, just press `r` on the metro bundler terminal to reload the app.



# Troubleshooting

### Clean Build
```
# For all platforms
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# For android
rm -rf android/app/.cxx
(cd android && ./gradlew clean)

# For iOS
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods
rm -rf ios/Pods
rm -rf ios/Podfile.lock
rm -rf ios/build
(cd ios && RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 pod install)

# For all platforms
watchman watch-del .
watchman watch-project .
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

### "Unable to boot simulator" error for iOS Simulator

* Go to [About this Mac > Storage > Manage > Developer]
* Delete XCode caches

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
